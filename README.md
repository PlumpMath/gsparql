gsparql
=======

SPARQL client written in Guile

This is an attempt to port SPARQL library from [NeuroCommons][nc-sparql],
(written for Scheme48), experiment with it in the process of porting,
learn Scheme/Guile, build upon the library (and if possible, contribute
to the original).

The most recent version of the original `sparql.sch` is available at
[NeuroCommons SVN][svn].
